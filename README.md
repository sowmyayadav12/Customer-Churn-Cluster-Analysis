# Customer-Churn-Cluster-Analysis

## Overview

This project explores customer behavior using cluster analysis to understand and mitigate customer churn. The goal is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics and find insights that can help reduce churn.

## Background

Customer churn, or customers stopping the use of a service, is a crucial metric for businesses. Reducing churn is important for sustainable growth. This project aims to analyze customer data and uncover patterns that contribute to churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customers, including features like total charges, monthly charges, contract type, and tenure.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-cluster-analysis.git
cd customer-churn-cluster-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explore the project and run scripts or notebooks. Adjust configuration settings if needed.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encode categorical variables.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Using clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to identify customer groups.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand the identified clusters.

## Results

The analysis aims to reveal insights about customer behavior and factors influencing churn, providing valuable information for business strategies.
